# BikeSharingProgram

This program is an application that will manage bikes available for a bike sharing
network. The user is able to rent/return a bike at different stations and has some more 
functionality as shown below:

1) Show all information about a particular station

2) Check if a bike is available at a particular station. If so, how many bikes are
available? (If available, would you like to rent? If not, provide directions to nearest station)

3) List all stations that have bikes available and rent a bike from one of these stations

4) List all stations that are not filled to capacity and return bike to one of these stations
